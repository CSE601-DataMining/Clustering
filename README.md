Clustering
==========

 Implement three clustering algorithms to find clusters of genes that exhibit similar expression  profiles: K-means, Hierarchical Agglomerative clustering with Single Link (Min), and one from  (density-based, mixture model, spectral).  Set up a single-node Hadoop cluster on your machine and implement MapReduce K-means.  Compare with non-parallel K-means on the given data sets. Try to improve the running time.
